First we gotta search for certain word using the double quotes: 

Example: 

    search for an specify name "Terrifier 2" and it is going to search only for
    the page or websites that contain the word Terrifier 2. 

 For exmaple: If we want to search for more than one specify word, we use the
plus sign: 

Example: 

    "Terrifier 2" + "David Howard Thornton";

If we want to search something and we dont want it to have a certain word, can
be a place or wherever we want to. For this we use the minus sign;

        "David Howard Thrnton" -"Terrifier 2"

If we want to serach for two things and only get one result we can use the OR
opeartor 

Example: 

        "Terrifier 2" OR "Terrifier" + "2016" OR "2022"

        The above example it's going to find ot Terrifier 2 a movie from 2022
        or terrifier a movie from 2016
